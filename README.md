# Innovation Novelty and Firm Value: Deep Learning-based Text Understanding

## Abstract:

Innovation is widely acknowledged as a key driver of firm performance, with patents serving as unique indicators of a companyâ€™s technological advancements. This study aims to investigate the impact of textual novelty within patents on firm performance, focusing specifically on biotechnology startups listed on the Nasdaq. Utilizing deep learning-based approaches, we construct measures for semantic originality in patent texts. Through panel vector autoregressive (VAR) analysis, our empirical findings demonstrate a positive correlation between textual novelty and abnormal stock returns. Further, impulse response function analysis indicates that the impact of textual novelty peaks approximately one week after patent issuance and gradually diminishes within a month. These insights offer valuable contributions to both the theoretical understanding and practical application of innovation management and strategic planning.
