# Patent-Text-Novelty-and-Firm-Market-Value

## Introduction

Novelty detection is classifying validation data, which differs from the data available during training. This can be seen as a "one-class classification", where a model is established to describe "normal" training data (Pimentel Marco et al., 2014). It is an important ability of a signal recognition scheme.

In this paper, we want to study the influences of the textual novelty of the patent on the stock value of the firm without using relevant scientific or expert evaluations as quality indicators. We will measure and evaluate existing novelty detection methods, then apply the best performing method to our patent data to find the relationship between patent novelty and firm value.
