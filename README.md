# Innovation Novelty and Firm Performance ---- Textual Measures

## Abstract:

The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the originality of patent text and firm value. Technological innovation is a key factor for economic development, and this study evaluates and compares three different methods for quantifying the originality of patent texts, specifically TFIDF-based Maximum Similarity, BERT-based Maximum Similarity, and Variational Autoencoder. The results show that the BERT-based model outperforms the other two methods in detecting the uniqueness of the patent text. Furthermore, this study establishes a positive link between BERT-based text novelty and firm value using ordinary least squares regression analysis of biotech start-ups. This study highlights the importance of detecting novel concepts to improve the efficiency and performance of identifying the impact of novelty in patent texts on firm value.
